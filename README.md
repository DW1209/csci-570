# DNA Sequence Alignment - Basic vs Efficient Approach
A Python-based implementation of DNA sequence alignment using two different approaches: a **basic dynamic algorithm** and a **memory-efficient divide-and-conquer algorithm**. This project compares their performance in terms of execution time and memory usage, visualized with automated plots.

## Features
- Aligns two DNA sequences using either a full-table or memory-optimized algorithm
- Automatically generates and processes input and output test data
- Measures and logs CPU time and memory usage
- Visualizes performance data through matplotlib plots
- Clean folder structure for testing, benchmarking, and reporting

## Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- `psutil` and `matplotlib` Python packages

## Installation
1. Clone and download this repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
You can run each approach manually or batch test all input files using the provided scripts:
### Run Basic Approach
```bash
./basic.sh input/in1.txt output/out1_basic.txt
```
### Run Efficient Approach
```bash
./efficient.sh input/in1.txt output/out1_effic.txt
```
### Run All Tests
```bash
python3 run.py
```
### Generate Performance Plots
```bash
python3 plot.py
```

## Input Format
Each input file should follow this structure:
```txt
<base string>
<insertion indices for string 1>
<base string>
<insertion indices for string 2>
```
This final DNA sequences are generated by recursively inserting the base strings at the specified indices.

## Output Format
Each output file contains:
1. Alignment cost
2. Aligned string 1
3. Aligned string 2
4. CPU time in milliseconds (ms)
5. Memory usage in kilobytes (KB)

Example:
```txt
168
CCAC-CA-GG
-CATGCAT-G
0.015974044 799804688
17856.0
```

## Performance Visualization
Generated using `plot.py` from test output results.

- **Memory vs Problem Size:** `pics/memory.png`

## Troubleshooting
Common issues:
- **Missing Python packages:** Install `psutil` and `matplotlib` if you encounter import errors
- **Memory issues:** Try reducing input size for large alignments when using the basic algorithm
- **Permission denied:** Make sure the shell script files are executable:
```bash
chmod +x basic.sh efficient.sh
```
